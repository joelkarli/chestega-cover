chestega-cover
==============

A chess steganography cover generator.

Basically, this generates a .pgn (portable game notation) file
of authenticated games and hides data in said file.

Installation
------------

There is no stable version of chestega-cover yet,
so I advise you to install it in a sandbox.

    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install -j

This will create a directory ".cabal-sandbox" and install it there.
